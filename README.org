A poorly named script to easily port-forward to an Amazon ECS container.
Intended for accessing remote nREPL instances, in theory it could be used for
anything.

* Dependencies
- [[https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation][babashka]]
- [[https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#installation][gum]]
- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html][AWS CLI]]
  - Including the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-troubleshooting.html#plugin-not-found][SSM plugin]]

* Install
The script is a self-contained babashka script, so place anywhere in your path
after =bb= and =gum= and it should be fine.

* Usage
#+begin_src shell :exports results :results code
./awssh -h
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src shell
awssh -- Easily port forward to an ECS container.

  -h, --help Show this help
  -p, --port Specify a port to use to skip prompting
#+end_src
