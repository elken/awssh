A poorly named script to easily port-forward or SSH to an Amazon ECS container.
Intended for accessing remote nREPL instances, in theory it could be used for
anything.

* Dependencies
- [[https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation][babashka]]
- [[https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum#installation][gum]]
- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html][AWS CLI]]
  - Including the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-troubleshooting.html#plugin-not-found][SSM plugin]]

* Install
The script is a self-contained babashka script, so place anywhere in your path
after =bb= and =gum= and it should be fine.

* Usage
#+begin_src shell :exports results :results code
./awssh -h
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src shell
awssh -- Easily port forward to an ECS container.

  -h, --help    Show this help
  -f, --forward Specify ports to forward to. Leave unset to ssh directly.

Use local:remote or 1 port for local & remote
#+end_src

As per the help doc, there are 3 modes of use here:

** Regular SSH
In order to just connect to an ECS container, run without any arguments and select the container from the list.
** Port forward on the same port
For this, pass the =-f= flag with a single port and that port will be used to forward both remotely and locally
** Port forward on different ports
For this, pass the =-f= flag with a portspec like =2222:8080= which will create a forward from the /local/ port =2222= to the /remote/ port =8080=
